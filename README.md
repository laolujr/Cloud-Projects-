### Cloud Projects 

The on-demand provisioning of compute services, particularly servers, data storage, networking, and processing power, without the need for direct user management is known as `cloud computing`. It is simply a pay-per-use model for renting Virtual resources.

Many clients choose Amazon Web Services (AWS) because it provides a wide range of cloud computing services and is affordable, dependable, scalable, user-friendly, and flexible. Its offerings include a combination of software as a service, platform as a service, and infrastructure as a service.

In this repository I would be  be showcasing how I deployed projects that I've successfully implemented in a production environment my GitHub repository using `Click Ops` and `Automation`.
I would be using several `Cloud` and `DevOps` tools like 
`AWS`,`Kubernetes`,`Docker`,`MongoDB`,`Terraform` `Azure` `GCP` etc.
