# Three-tier web application-
This document would work you through the steps I took in creating my first three-tier web application using the AWS Management console.
I leveraged on various cloud services to ensure my application was highly available,scalable and fault tolerrant.
To start off the deployment of my three-tier web application I designed the web-application architecture to give me a clear picture of what i wanted to create and to avoid mistakes.
Snapshots of my web application architecture is attached to this project
